Question 15
What does it mean for Dart to be a statically-typed language,
and how does it impact the way variables are used?

ðŸ”¹It means Dart enforces type safety, which means data type of a variable is determined
  at compile-time, Not run-time.
ðŸ”¹Which means once a variable is assigned a type, it can't be changed later to another type.
