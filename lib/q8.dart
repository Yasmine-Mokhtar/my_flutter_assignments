Question 8
What is the difference between the num and double data types in Dart?
ðŸ”¹Num is a primitive data type holds both integers and doubles, So It's more flexible
  It can be used in cases of switching between whole numbers and floating-point numbers.

ðŸ”¹Double holds just decimal numbers only, So It's more restrictive.
  Cause it does not accept integers.
