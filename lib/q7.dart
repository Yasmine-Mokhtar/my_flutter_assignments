void main(){
/*
Question 7
Given this code, identify any errors and explain why they occur:
```dart
void main() {
String name = "Alice";
name = 123;
print(name);
} ```

cause Dart is a statically typed language, you are trying to assign an integer value to a string variable
so, you can't try to assign an integer 123 to a String data type
You can Fix it by:
ðŸ”¹Adding 123 as a String between single or double quotation, If you want to Use only Strings.
ðŸ”¹Using Dynamic Data Type, If you need more flexibility, but be careful cause It removes type safety.
