Question 4
How can you declare a variable in Dart to store a person's age
and ensure it can only hold integer values? Write the code.
*/
  int age = 23;
/*
ğŸ”¹By specifying the data type as an integer,
ğŸ”¹Dart ensures that the variable can only store whole numbers
ğŸ”¹Cause Dart is a statically typed-language, it gonna enforce type safety at compile time.
ğŸ”¹That's why it's gonna throw an error at compile time, if you try to change the data type.
