Question 11
How do you concatenate strings in Dart? Write an example using two variables: firstName and lastName.
Concatenation is the process of merging two Strings or more using + operator,

  String firstName = "Yasmine";
  String lastName = "Mokhtar";
  print(firstName + lastName); // Concatenation
  print("$firstName $lastName"); // Interpolation
}
