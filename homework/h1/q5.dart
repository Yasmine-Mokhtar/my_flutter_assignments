Question 5
What is the difference between var and dynamic in Dart? Provide an example of each.
   */
  // Var is a keyword not a data type, during the declaration process, the data type be detected automatically based on the value,
  // Once inferred, that type can't change., so It supports type safety during compile-time

  // Dynamic is a weak data type, its pros is that its flexible, but it can cause run-time error if it be used carelessly
 // you can change it freely. It's flexible but risky (runtime errors).
